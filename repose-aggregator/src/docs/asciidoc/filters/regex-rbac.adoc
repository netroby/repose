= RegEx Role Based Access Control (RBAC) Filter

The RegEx Role Based Access Control (RBAC) filter provides a way to get API validation for services without the constraints of a WADL.

The <<../recipes/role-based-access-control.adoc#,Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)>> is achieved using a request header populated by an authentication filter.

== General filter information
* *Name:* regex-rbac
* *Default Configuration:* regex-rbac.cfg.xml
* *Released:* v8.7.3.0
* *Bundle:* repose-filter-bundle
* link:../schemas/regex-rbac.xsd[Schema]

== Prerequisites & Postconditions
=== Required Request Headers
* `X-Roles` - A header containing the roles belonging to the user making the request.

[NOTE]
====
This header is not configurable.
====

=== Required Preceding Filters
This filter has no dependencies on other filters and can be placed wherever it is needed in the filter chain.

However, due to the nature of this filter, it is typically placed early in the filter chain immediately after any authentication filters.

=== Request Headers Created
* `X-Relevant-Roles` - Lists the user roles from the `X-Roles` header which matched allowing access to the requested resource.
This header will contain `ANY` and/or `ALL` if a match allowing access is a resource containing one of these wildcard roles.
* `X-Delegated` - Provides details about the failure being delegated by this filter.
This is mainly intended for use by the <<herp.adoc#, Highly Efficient Record Processor (HERP) filter>> and <<derp.adoc#, Delegation Response Processor (DeRP) filter>> for internal delegation processing within *Repose*.
However, it can be exposed to the origin service under certain configurations.

[NOTE]
====
This header is only added if delegation is enabled.
====

=== Request Body Changes
This filter does not modify the request body.

=== Recommended Follow-On (Succeeding) Filters
This filter is not strictly required by any other filters.

=== Response Body Changes
This filter does not modify the response body.

=== Response Headers Created
This filter does not create/modify any response headers.

=== Response Status Codes
[cols="2", options="header,autowidth"]
.Status Codes
|===
| Status Code
| Reasons
| `403`
| A requested resource or method requires a specific `X-Roles` request header value that was not found.

| `404`
| The filter determined that the URI is invalid.

  When `mask-rax-roles-403` attribute is enabled (i.e. `true`), this could also indicate the supplied `X-Roles` request header value did not have access to the URI or possibly only with the requested method.

| `405`
| The URI is valid, but the Method is not appropriate for the URI.

== Examples
=== Basic Example
This configuration is a basic example that exhibits a common use-case.

.regex-rbac.cfg.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<regex-rbac xmlns="http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/regex-rbac/v1.0">
    <resources> <!--1-->
       /path/[^/]+/.* GET admin <!--2-->
    </resources>
</regex-rbac>
----
<1> Defines the available resources locally in the config.
Resources are listed one per line in the `<PATH> <METHODS> <ROLES>` format.
That is, each line should present the path to the resource, any amount of whitespace, the methods available on the resource, a set of whitespace, and the roles which grant access to the resource.
If a resource is not listed, requests to that resource will be rejected.
<2> Defines a single resource at `/path/{any-single-segment}/{anything}` that can only be accessed with a `GET` and only if the `X-Roles` header has the required `admin` role.

[NOTE]
====
The resources are defined using http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Java Regular Expressions].
The requested resource endpoint must exactly match a RegEx to be considered a match.
That is to say, there can not be any extra characters in the request, including or excluding trailing slashes, that are not accounted for in the RegEx.
====

[NOTE]
====
`ANY` and `ALL` act as special wildcards for both HTTP methods and roles.
====

[NOTE]
====
Roles are only allowed to have spaces in the names through the use of an embedded Non-Breaking Space (NBSP) (i.e. Unicode character: `00A0`).

<1> The resource at `/path/{any-single-segment}/this` can only be accessed with a `GET` if the `X-Roles` header has at least one of the required roles: `role1`, `role2`, `role3`, or `role4`
<2> The resource at `/path/{any-single-segment}/this` can only be accessed with a `PUT` if the `X-Roles` header has at least one of the required roles: `role1`, `role2`, or `role3`

<4> The resource at `/path/{any-single-segment}/this` can only be accessed with a `DELETE` if the `X-Roles` header has the required role: `role1`
<5> The resource at `/path/{any-single-segment}/that` can only be accessed with a `GET` or `PUT`, but there is no required role that must be in the `X-Roles` header.
<6> The resource at `/Path/{any-single-segment}` can only be accessed with a `GET` and must either have the `admin` role or both `role1` and `role2` in the `X-Roles` header.
<7> The resource at `/Path/{any-single-segment}/{anything}` can be accessed with any HTTP method, but must have either `admin` of `role with space` in the `X-Roles` header.

=== Full Example with External Resources File
This configuration is a full example that uses every possible configuration item.
It does not, however, cover the resources format, as including resources both inline and via the `href` attribute will cause only the inline resources to be used.

----
<1> If set to true, instead of returning a FORBIDDEN (403) or a METHOD NOT ALLOWED (405), the response will be a NOT FOUND (404).
    (Default: `false`)
<2> Inclusion of this element prevents this filter from returning errors, and directs this filter to populate delegation headers instead.
<3> Specifies the quality of specific output headers.
    When setting up a chain of delegating filters, the highest quality number will be the one that is eventually output.
    (Default: `0.3`)
<4> The component name used in the delegation header.
    This is particularly useful when multiple instances of an API-Checker based filter are used in the same filter chain.
    (Default: `regex-rbac`)
<5> Specifies a location to an external file which contains the RegEx RBAC resources.
    If the message element has a value and the `href` attribute is configured, the RegEx RBAC will use what is configured in the value.
    If the file that the `href` attribute points to is modified, the RegEx RBAC will not reload the configuration.
    So the new RBAC file should be placed in a new file name (e.g. Dated) and the regex-rbac.cfg.xml file updated to point to it in order to guarantee the changes are utilized.

== Additional Information

=== Delegation
In some cases, you may want to delegate the validation of a request down the chain to either another filter or to the origin service.
Delegation prevents the RegEx RBAC filter from failing the request by forwarding the request with the `X-Delegated` header that is set with a value which indicates how the filter would have failed if not in delegating mode.

To place the filter in delegating mode, add the `delegating` element to the filter configuration with a quality that determines the delegation priority.

The format for the `X-Delegated` header value is:

- `status_code={status-code}`component={filter-name}`message={failure message};q={delegating-quality}`
