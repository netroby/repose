= API Validator Filter

The API Validator filter validates all requests against a configured https://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl/[Web Application Description Language (WADL)] file.
For example, if a request to the origin service is missing the tenant ID in the URI, but the origin service requires the tenant ID to be there, then the request will be rejected before it reaches the origin service.
The API Validator filter can also be configured to validate the content of the request body against an https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/xmlschema[XML Schema Definition (XSD)] or http://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema] referenced as a grammar in the WADL.

[NOTE]
====
A working knowledge of WADL's and XSD's/JSON Schemas will make the configuration of this filter much easier.
Therefore, it is recommended that you read up on these subjects before attempting to use this filter.
A good tutorial on XSD 1.1, including a comparison of XSD 1.1 and XSD 1.0, is located at:

* http://www.xfront.com/xml-schema-1-1/[XML Schema 1.1 Tutorial]

Most of the ideas described in this conference session are implemented in this filter:

== General filter information
* *Name:* api-validator
* *Default Configuration:* validator.cfg.xml
* *Released:* v2.1.6
* *Bundle:* repose-extensions-filter-bundle
* link:../schemas/validator-configuration.xsd[Schema]

== Prerequisites & Postconditions
=== Required Request Headers
This filter does not require any request headers.

However, the configuration can require specific headers and/or values be present in order to successfully exit this filter.
The most common use of a request header by this filter is for <<../recipes/role-based-access-control.adoc#,Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)>> using the `X-Roles` header populated by the <<../filters/keystone-v2.adoc#,Keystone v2 filter>>.

=== Required Preceding Filters
This filter has no dependencies on other filters and can be placed wherever it is needed in the filter chain.

However, due to the nature of this filter it is typically placed early in the filter chain immediately after any authentication filters.

=== Request Headers Created
* `X-Relevant-Roles` - Lists the values of the `X-Roles` header which match a `rax:roles` value from the WADL for the resource being requested.
In other words, `X-Relevant-Roles` are the user roles which granted access to the resource.
This header is only added to the request if `enable-rax-roles` is configured to be true.
* `X-Delegated` - Provides details about the failure being delegated by this filter.
This is mainly intended for use by the <<herp.adoc#, Highly Efficient Record Processor (HERP) filter>> and <<derp.adoc#, Delegation Response Processor (DeRP) filter>> for internal delegation processing within *Repose*.
However, it can be exposed to the origin service under certain configurations.
This header is only added if delegation is enabled.

=== Request Body Changes
This filter does not modify the request body.

=== Recommended Follow-On (Succeeding) Filters
This filter is not strictly required by any other filters.

=== Response Body Changes
This filter does not modify the response body.

=== Response Headers Created
This filter does not create/modify any response headers.

=== Response Status Codes
[cols="2", options="header,autowidth"]
.Status Codes
|===
| Status Code
| Reasons

| `400`
| The body of a request fails to validate.

| `401`
| A requested resource or method requires a specific `X-Authenticated-By` request header value that was not found.

| `403`
| A requested resource or method requires a specific `X-Roles` request header value that was not found.

| `404`
| The filter determined that the URI is invalid.

  When `mask-rax-roles-403` attribute is enabled (i.e. `true`), this could also indicate the supplied `X-Roles` request header value did not have access to the URI.

| `405`
| The URI is valid, but the Method is not appropriate for the URI.

  When `mask-rax-roles-403` attribute is enabled (i.e. `true`), this could also indicate the supplied `X-Roles` request header value had access to the URI, but not the requested Method.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Through the use of the `rax:code` WADL extension, any of these default codes can be overridden to any value.

== Examples
=== Basic Example
This configuration is the most basic example of this filter's configuration.

[source,xml]
.validator.cfg.xml
----
<validators xmlns="http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/validator/v1.0">
    <validator role="default" <!--1-->
               default="true" <!--2-->
               wadl="file:///path/to/wadl/file.wadl" <!--3-->
    />
</validators>
----
<1> The `role` attribute is deprecated, but is currently required and doesn't have a default value.
<2> The `default` attribute is deprecated, but currently has a default value of `false`.
<3> This is the fully qualified URI for where the WADL file can be located.

[TIP]
====
Even though multiple `validator` element definitions and the `role` and `default` attributes on each are deprecated, the easiest way to future proof new configurations is to:

* define a single `validator` as this will eventually become the root element
* define that `validator` element with:
** a `role` attribute with the value of `default`
** a `default` attribute with the value of `true`
====

=== All the features of a `validator` element

</validators>
----
<1> List of roles from which at least one role must match a role in the request for this validator to be applied.
    Triggers off of `X-Roles` header. +
    *DEPRECATED:* Roles defined outside of the WADL will not be supported in *Repose* 9 and this attribute will not be available.
<2> If the api-validator config `multi-match` is set to `true` then the default validator will be the first validator to process the incoming request.
    If multi-match is set to `false` and if no validator is matched to the users' roles, then the filter will use the default validator. (Default: `false`) +
    *DEPRECATED:* Multiple validators will not be supported in *Repose* 9 and this attribute will not be available.
<3> Location of the WADL to associate with this validator.
    If not specified, then the wadl needs to be embedded within the validator element.
    Can be located within the file system or pointed to a remote file.
    Can use absolute or relative path. +
    *DEPRECATED:* This attribute is currently optional, but will be *required* in *Repose* 9.
    Currently both a WADL file and embedded WADL can not be defined.
    Currently at least a WADL file or embedded WADL must be defined.
<4> If set to `true`, this validator will record, via JMX, the number of times each state in the generated state machine (the mechanism underlying api validation) is accessed.
    These values may be used to determine api usage and coverage. (Default: `false`)
<5> The DOT output file for this validator.
    DOT is a plain text graph description language that is a simple way of describing graphs that both humans and applications can use.
<6> Check that the request body is well-formed XML or JSON that conforms to the XML or JSON syntax rules. (Default: `false`)
<7> If set to `true` and the WADL references an XSD or JSON grammar(s), then the incoming request body will be validated against the grammar(s). (Default: `false`)
<8> If set to `true` and the WADL request representation contains an element the filter will check the root element of a request.  (Default: `false`)
<9> If set to `true` and the WADL has plain parameters defined, then the filter will check the plain parameters. (Default: `false`)
<10> Allow XSD grammar transform.
     Transform the XML after validation, to fill in things like default values. (Default: `false`)
<11> If set to `true` allows the filter to perform a transform before xsd validation takes place.
     The transformation rules can be defined in the WADL via the Rackspace WADL extension: `rax:preprocess` (Default: `true`)
<12> Analyzes the state machine generated from the WADL and makes sure that there aren't any duplicate nodes in the machine. (Default: `true`)
<13> XPath version used in the WADL.
     Can be 1 or 2. (Default: `1`) +
     *NOTE:* _IF_ 1 is set, _THEN_ the Xalan implementation will be used; _ELSE IF_ 2, _THEN_ Saxon will be used. +
     *NOTE:* XPath 2 with schema awareness requires a Saxon license.
<14> Indicates the XSL engine to use from the possible list of: +
     *&deg; Xalan* - Standard Java XSL engine +
     *&deg; XalanC* - compiles XSL into byte code and is a very efficient 1.0 engine (Default) +
     *&deg; SaxonHE* - Implements v2.0 of the XSL language, but gives a license error when attempting a transform. +
     *&deg; SaxonEE* - Implements v2.0 of the XSL language, and allows transforms. +
     *NOTE:* Even though Saxon is an XSL 2.0 engine, most 1.0 XSLs should work fine.
<15> Indicates the XSD engine to use for validation from the possible list of: +
     *&deg; Xerces* (Default) +
     *&deg; SaxonEE* +
     *NOTE:* The SaxonEE validator requires a license.
<16> Enables the use of the rax:ignoreXSD extension in WADL files to exclude some representations from validation against the XSD.  (Default: `true`)
<17> This is an optimization where the well formed check and multiple XPath checks can be merged into a single check. (Default: `true`)
<18> Sets the name for this validator.
     The name is used as the MBean name when connecting to *Repose* via JMX.
<19> If set to true and the WADL defines required headers then the filter will check that those required headers are present. (Default: `false`)
<20> Enables the use of `rax:roles` in WADL files to determine resource access. (Default: `false`) +
     *NOTE:* _IF_ `true`, _THEN_ `rax:roles` defined in the supplied WADL files will be used to determine resource access. +
     *NOTE:* _IF_ `true`, _THEN_ `check-headers` will also be enabled regardless of it's setting.
<21> Mask `rax-roles` with `404` and `405` errors.
     By default `rax-roles` responds with a `403` if there is a role mismatch.
     If this is set to `true`, then the response will be `404` if no methods are accessible or `405` if some methods are available. (Default: `false`)
<22> If set to `true`, then the validity of the generated state machine is checked (e.g. no dead-end paths, there is a single start state, no orphaned nodes, etc.). (Default: `true`)

=== Enable Delegation
To place this filter in <<../recipes/delegation.adoc#,Delegation>> mode, add the `delegating` element to the filter configuration with an optional `quality` attribute that determines the delegating priority.

[source,xml]
.validator.cfg.xml
----
<validators xmlns="http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/validator/v1.0">
    <validator role="default"
               default="true"
               wadl="file:///path/to/wadl/file.wadl"
    />
    <delegating quality="0.3"/> <!--1--> <!--2-->
</validators>
----
<1> If this element is present, then delegation is enabled.
    Delegation will cause this filter to pass requests it would ordinarily reject along with a header detailing why it would have rejected the request.
<2> Indicates the quality that will be added to any output headers.
    When setting up a chain of delegating filters the highest quality number will be the one that is eventually output. (Default: `0.3`)

=== Deprecated Multi-Validator Definition
This configuration shows the deprecated, but currently legal, multi-validator definition as well as an embedded WADL which is also deprecated.
